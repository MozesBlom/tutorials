## Description
This folder contains the instructions and some background lecture for a course Exercise on the phylogenetic placement of two Crocodile mitogenomes. The aim of the exercise is to locate and download data on genbank, conduct and visually inspect a multiple sequence alignment and to infer a ML or Bayesian phylogeny. The exercise can be done on its own but has been developed as a practical exercise for the MSc course Phylogenetics in Ecology & Evolution at Potsdam University.
