    "In a previous [tutorial on ML](https://github.com/MozesBlom/tutorials/tree/main/2025_PU_Phylo_Eco_Evol/ML), we have learnt how IQtree3 can be used to infer a Maximum-Likelihood phylogeny for a single alignment. However, we have also learnt that novel genomic approaches enable us to generate genome-scale datasets and that there is often incongruence between gene-trees and the species-tree. See this [Review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-023-00620-x) with some further details. Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) and interspecfic hybridization are two evolutionary processes that are frequently investigated as possible explanations for widespread discordance. In the [tutorial on ILS](https://github.com/MozesBlom/tutorials/tree/main/2025_PU_Phylo_Eco_Evol/ILS), we used msprime to simulate different evolutionary scenarios and demonstrated how the interaction between divergence time and effective population size can determine the extent of ILS, while at the same time interspecific gene flow can lead to additional incongruence between gene- and species tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the present tutorial is to bring this all together and demonstrate how we can use large-scale datasets to infer phylogenies for genomic windows spread across a chromosome. These individual window trees can then be used to infer a summary-coalescent species tree and we will use gene- and site-concordance factor to investigate how well specific branches are supported across all trees. Finally, by doing so, I also want to demonstrate how you can upload your own datasets to Google Colab and how we can use Command-Line for phylogenetic inference of larger datasets."

    "The endemic jewel-babblers of New Guinea (genus: Ptilorrhoa) comprise 17 named taxa divided into four recognized species. Together with quail-thrushes (genus: Cinclosoma) they represent one family (Cinclosomatidae) out of 31 Corvides families within passerine birds. The taxonomic division is based on plumage patterns and geographic distributions, which span the lowlands (Ptilorrhoa caerulescens (0‚àí300 m.a.s.l.) and P. geislerorum (0‚àí1200 m.a.s.l.)), lower montane elevations (P. castanonota (900‚Äì1450 m.a.s.l.)) and the highlands (P. leucosticta (1750‚Äì2400 m.a.s.l.)). Thus, Ptilorrhoa species represent various examples of geographical and elevational displacement across New Guinea. However, much remained still unclear regarding the true species diversity and the phylogenetic relationships between various (sub-)species. To address this issue, [Blom et al. 2025](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0611) assembled a draft reference genome for a closely related outgroup and whole-genome resequencing data for a large number of representatives across all named species, sub-species and with a geographic spread that matches the known distribution for each lineage."

    "The average avian genome-size is roughly 1.3 Gb and it would be computationally too challenging to replicate the phylogenetic study in its entirety. To reduce computational complexity, [Blom et al. 2025](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0611) did not infer phylogenies based on the entire genome but instead sampled and filtered genomic 'windows' that were each 10kb. in size and sampled at least 100 Kb. apart. This resulted in **8097** autosomal and **614** Z-linked genomic 'windows'. Every genomic window is effectively a chunk of the genome and can include exons, introns, regulatory elements etc. Nonetheless, across large numbers of loci and relatively large window sizes this should not affect our phylogenetic estimate (topology in particular) too much. Here, we analyse a small subset of this dataset, namely 50 autosomal window alignments randomly sampled from Chromosome 1. For each of these genomic windows, we will infer a ML phylogeny and we will aggregate these window trees to then infer a summary-coalescent species tree. Finally, we will introduce a new proxy for assessing confidence in each branch."

    "Running a full multi-species coalescent analysis is only feasible in a Bayesian framework. In such cases, both the species tree and gene trees are co-estimated and each have different parameters associated that require evaluation. This is frequently computationally intractable and for large-scale datasets we therefore often resort to a two-step approach where we first estimate gene trees and then infer the species tree based on the frequency distribution of gene trees. This means of course that during this second step we assume that the gene trees inferred are correct (and you now know that inferring phylogenies is not a trivial exercise!). Here we will use such a two-step approach and use the 50 gene trees that we have inferred above to estimate an ASTRAL summary-coalescent phylogeny. I will not dive much deeper into the theory behind summary-coalescent approaches, but see this [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0233-0) if you would like to know more! The main aim here is to demonstrate how to infer a summary-coalescent phylogeny in practice and how we can annotate uncertainty via gene and site concordance factors."

    "ASTRAL has generated the phylogeny that is statistically concordant with a full-coalescent Bayesian species tree approach. It has taken the underlying distribution of gene trees and summarized that into a species tree. You may have noticed that ASTRAL ran incredibly fast and this is because it's only estimating the species tree topology, it doesn't do anything in terms of phylogenetic inference of the gene trees (e.g. likelihood calculations etc.). However, the support annotation is a bit confusing and what we really would like to know is how many of the underlying window trees support any given relationship in the Species Tree. We can do this with Gene concordance factors in IQtree3. Gene concordance factors are basically conveying the number of genes/window trees support a given relationship across the tree. Here is some further information with regards to gCF: [link](https://iqtree.github.io/doc/Concordance-Factor#putting-it-all-together)"
